Kudajadri Drizzle is more than just a homestay; it's a piece of Wayanadâ€™s history. Converted from a traditional Jain Tharavadu, our homestay retains its cultural charm while offering modern amenities. The homely ambiance, combined with authentic Jain cuisine and warm hospitality, makes us the perfect choice for families, couples, and groups alike.
